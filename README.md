The Verilog code of a 32-bit carry look-ahead adder (CLA) is given, which is referred to as "ccla_32b_4x8.v" 
The gate-level netlist of the automatically generated high-speed adder, obtained by synthesizing "ccla_32b_4x8) by setting 'set_dp_smartgen_options -optimize_for speed' to true and the 'compile_ultra' command, is called "ahsa_32b.v"
